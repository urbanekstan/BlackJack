---- To compile ----
--------------------

javac src/**/*.java -d build/
java -cp build/ GamePlay

--------------------------------
---- File naming convention ----
--------------------------------

Single word names (eg Card, Player, Phases.java) are interfaces.
Double word name (eg PlayingCard, ActivePlayer.java) are classes that implement such interfaces.
(Mirrored after Oracle's structuring, w Card/PlayingCard and Deck/StandardDeck)

-----------------
---- Classes ----
-----------------

src/CardCounter:
CardCounter.java   Counter.java

src/DeckOfCards:
Card.java  Deck.java  PlayingCard.java  StandardDeck.java

src/GamePlay:
GamePlay.java   Phases.java

src/Players:

------------------
---- Design ------
------------------

~ GamePlay is highest level object - handles game flow, interactions between player(s)/dealer and deck

~ GamePlay instantiates:

 - StandardDeck obj : represents the Deck
 - ActivePlayer obj : represents player's hands, counts
 - CardCounter obj  : tracks running count
[- BlackJackGUI obj : displays game play ]
[- CardPanel obj    : displays cards     ]

~ ActivePlayer class implements Player interface

~ StandardDeck is borrowed from Oracle's Java examples
 - StandardDeck class implements Deck interface 
 - PlayingCard  class implements Card interface

~ CardCounter class implements Counter interface
